# COVID-19 Policy Impact Analysis

## Overview
This project analyzes the impact of COVID-19 policies (e.g., stay-at-home mandates, vaccine rollouts) on cases, deaths, and hospitalizations using the CDC COVID-19 Case Surveillance Dataset. It employs **PySpark** for distributed data processing and **Python** for visualization.

## Features
- **Data Pipeline**: Processed and cleaned 100M+ records using PySpark for efficient analysis.
- **Policy Impact Evaluation**: Assessed temporal trends in case, death, and hospitalization rates in response to major policies.
- **Risk Analysis**: Evaluated mortality rates among individuals with pre-existing medical conditions.

## Technologies
- **Processing**: PySpark, Python
- **Visualization**: Matplotlib
- **Dataset**: CDC COVID-19 Case Surveillance

## Key Insights
- Vaccines reduced hospitalizations and deaths significantly.
- High mortality persisted for individuals with pre-existing conditions.
- Policies like stay-at-home mandates flattened case peaks.
